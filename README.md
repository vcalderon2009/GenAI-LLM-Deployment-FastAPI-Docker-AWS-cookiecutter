# FastAPI to AWS Deployment - Cookiecutter template

This project provides a cookiecutter template to jumpstart a FastAPI
application with the idea to deploy it to AWS via Github's CICD.

The template provides an initial foundation for building, packaging, and
deploying a FastAPI application to AWS via the creation of the corresponding
Docker images and python packages and applications.
